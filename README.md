### **A finally good design for Windows widgets.**

Windgets number one priorty is design. It aims to bring a minimalistic, modern, and clean feel to your desktop.

## Big Drawbacks

Unfortunately on startup, with the executable in shell:startup, it is delayed before most people open apps. So if you are one to quickly open apps when your pc starts, theres a chance that the widgets will start on top of your currently open window and not your desktop.

If this happens the best solution is to do ```Win + M``` and then quickly after do ```Win + Shift + M```. This forces all the windows to minimize, then to reopen, which pushes the windgets to the back.
